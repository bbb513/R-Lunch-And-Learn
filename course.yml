title: R Lunch and Learn
author_field: Barry Barrios, Daniel Chertok, Peter Arroyo
description: The course is designed to teach you how to use the R software for real-world
  problems. We'll start out with an introduction to R and master the basics of this
  beautiful open source language on the first day. Onwards, we'll rapidly go over
  ROracle, predictive modeling, how to create your own R package, etc. <br><br>This
  course takes a hands-on approach where we each follow along using our computers.
  We take an unconventional approach. Why lecture from my notes? You can read them.
  You stay on task by, preparing questions and problems for the R-Lunch-And_Learn;
  We each follow along on R assignments discussing with colleagues and myself; Meeting
  with me individually; Applying R to cases I introduce.<br><br> The advantage, you
  get what you want out of the course. Let's try it and see what happens.
